> **Real PR timelines from the community   not only IRCC’s generic estimate.**

**Free, open-source Canadian PR processing tracker**   built for applicants, by applicants (and maintained with care by [GetNorthPath](https://www.getnorthpath.com)). AORTrack turns crowd-sourced milestones into timelines you can compare by **AOR date, stream, and province**, so you see where you sit relative to people on a similar path.

## 🚀 What we do

AORTrack is a **community-powered** companion for **Canadian permanent residency** processing: you (and others) share milestone dates, and the app aggregates patterns so everyone gets **clearer expectations** than a one-size-fits-all IRCC bar.

We do **not** replace IRCC, lawyers, or consultants   we **surface what the community is actually experiencing**, including delays, stream differences, and outliers worth knowing about.
