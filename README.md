# 🍁 AORTrack

![AORTrack — banner](public/Mountain.png)

> **Real PR timelines from the community — not only IRCC’s generic estimate.**

**Free, open-source Canadian PR processing tracker** — built for applicants, by applicants (and maintained with care by [GetNorthPath](https://www.getnorthpath.com)). AORTrack turns crowd-sourced milestones into timelines you can compare by **AOR date, stream, and province**, so you see where you sit relative to people on a similar path.

## 🚀 What we do

AORTrack is a **community-powered** companion for **Canadian permanent residency** processing: you (and others) share milestone dates, and the app aggregates patterns so everyone gets **clearer expectations** than a one-size-fits-all IRCC bar.

We do **not** replace IRCC, lawyers, or consultants — we **surface what the community is actually experiencing**, including delays, stream differences, and outliers worth knowing about.

## 🛠️ Tech stack

Built to stay fast and transparent at the edge of a messy, real-world dataset:

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org) 16** — App Router, server components where it fits
- **[React](https://react.dev) 19** + **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) 4** — UI
- **[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)** — Application data and aggregates
- **[Socket.io](https://socket.io/)** — Realtime community updates (custom `server.mjs` in dev/prod)
- **TypeScript** — End-to-end typing

---

## 🗺️ Who it’s for

- **PR applicants in Canada or abroad** who want **signal from peers**, not only official averages  
- **Forum & community moderators** who need a **neutral, linkable stats layer** for discussions  
- **Developers** who want to **fork, extend, or self-host** a transparent tracker
